## Monetary Policy and the Real World

### The natural rate of unemployment and Okun's law

GDP growth and unemployment rate are negatively correlated.

Okun's law
```
Change in real GDP / GDP = k - beta * change in unemployment rate
```

There is a natural unemployment rate due to
- friction: it takes time to find a job
- seasonality


### Philips curve

PPI is more volatile than CPI but they two track the movement 
well over the long term.

The Philips curve refers to the inverse relationship between
wage inflation and unemployment rate.

During 1971 - 1991, there is NO well defined relationship 
between inflation and unemployment. However, you can 
identify three Philips curve if you look more closely.

### How changes in monetary policy affects the economy?

The short term interest rate and the fed funds rate 
move alongside each other.

Interest rate affects
- Cost of financing
- Import and export
- Stock valuation (due to cash flow discount)


### The bank lending channel

How banks make money? Since the long term interest rate is 
higher than the short term rate, the banks make money by
borrowing short and lending long. 

Money policy influences the profit margin of the banks,
and thus the overall credit supply in the market.
