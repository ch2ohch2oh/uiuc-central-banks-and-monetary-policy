## Week 1 The Market for Federal Funds

### Fed funds market

Banks borrow **short-term** but lend **long-term**. 
Banks hold reverses at the federal reverse to meet liquidity requirement.

Prior to March 2020, banks were requried to hold around 3% as reserve, depending
on the bank size. Due to the COVID, the reserve was set to zero.

Banks can hold **excess reserve** to meet unexpected liquidity requirements.

Banks need to choose between:
- Save the money in reserve
- Make a loan and collect interest

Reserves have increased **significantly** since 2009. Billions to trillions.

When banks need liquidity, they can
- Borrow from federal funds market: overnight and **no collateral**

The federal funds rate influences all other interest rates.
It determines to cost of credit and has a stronger effect on 
shorter maturity assets.

### Repo market

Selling the repo is effectively borrowing.
The repo is collaterelized. The risk of repo is in the 
market value of the collateral.
 
Most repos are **over collaterolized** making the 
risk for the repo buyer small. 

Most repos involve a third-party custodian. Both parties of the
repo hold an account at the custodian so they do not need 
to deal with the transfer of securities etc.

The fed funds market can be only accessed by banks, whereas
the repo market has more players.

### Money market mutual funds

Long time ago, there was a ceiling for the bank 
deposit rate. Money market funds were not subject
to this limit.

Money market funds are **not FDIC insured**.

around 4500B before 2008.
