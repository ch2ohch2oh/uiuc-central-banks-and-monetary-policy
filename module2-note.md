## Week 2 The Federal Reserve System

### The federal reserve

Why central banks?
- Maintain price stability 
- Lender of last resort

The Federal Reserve System was established in 1913.

FOMC
- 12 members
- set interest rates

Five key functions of the fed
1. Monetary policy 
    + Maximum employment
    + Stable prices (2% inflation target)
2. Financial stability 
    + Required by Dodd-Frank Act
3. Regulation and supervision
4. Offering a payment system
5. Promoting consumer protection

### Money supply

The **quantitative thoery of money** states:
the value of all goods and services has to be equal
to the total money supply.

```
Total money supply = Money supply  x  Velocity of money
Total expenditure = Total number of transactions
of goods and services  x  Price
-----
M  x  V = P  x  T
```

M1 = currency in circulation + reserve balances + 
checking account balances.

M2 = M1 + saving desposits +
small time deposits + money market fund shares

M3 = M2 + large time deposits + institutional
money market fund shares + repos


### The fed balance sheet

Take a look at the fed balance sheet over time. 
It never came back to its historical level
after the 2008 financial crisis.

The fed balance sheet has incrased dramatically 
since 2008, but the money supply is increasing
at a relatively steady rate. 
Most of the money created was the reserves
of depository institutions.

For the balance sheet of the fed:
1. Asset = government securities
2. Liabilities = currency + bank reserves


### Open market operations

The FOMC decides the fed fund target rate.
The implementation is delegated to the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

As banks hold more excess reverses at the fed,
the fed's ability to influence money supply 
by changing the fed funds rate is limited.

The fed funds rate is a guide-post. The 
real rate in which banks borrow from each 
other is called the **effective fed funds rate**.

### The discount window

The banks can borrow from the fed at
the discount rate, instead of borrowing
from other banks.
The fed will accept various collateral 
for the discount loan.


In general,
```
discount rate > fed funds rate
```
